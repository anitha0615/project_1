Homebuyers Guide to the Texas Market
Where should you end up?

Project Description:

We will be determining “hotspots” in Texas for areas where housing prices are rising. Along with finding the hotspots, we will also be on the lookout for areas where housing prices are falling, and where they are relatively stable.

Main Questions:
Where are housing prices rising the most in the past 6 years?
Where have prices fallen? AKA where do you want to stay away from in your home investment?
You don’t want to worry about moving around anymore? We’ll also tell you where prices have been the most stable over the last 6 years!

Potentially look at years 2010-2017 to compare COVID trends from then to more recent;
also can make our own “Livability Index” with factors such as healthcare, education, public safety, and infrastructure to determine if we think areas are over-/under-valued.

Datasets being used:

We will be using Zillow data that we retrieved from NASDAQ Data Link: data.nasdaq.com

This data is coming from three separate files containing housing value data for the entire U.S.

We will be trimming this data down and only using data for the state of Texas.


Who’s doing what (subject to change):

Anitha & Kent: Pulling data and making it pretty

Sujatha & Misty: Finding trends in housing prices

Zach: Visualizing the data
